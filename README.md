# Salifort Motors Predicting Employee Turnover and Improving Retention
 This repository contains my capstone project for the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. In this project, I take on the role of a data specialist at *Salifort Motors*, a fictional global leader in alternative energy vehicles. Faced with rising employee turnover, Salifort's leadership seeks data-driven insights to improve retention. I analyze survey data to identify key factors influencing employee departures and develop predictive models—including logistic regression and tree-based machine learning models like decision trees, random forest, and XGBoost—to forecast attrition. This end-to-end project showcases my ability to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and stakeholder communication through a structured business case.
